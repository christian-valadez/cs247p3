    affectsWomen: "Showing gender diversity in recruitment lets women know that there are people at your company who look like them, decreasing the likelihood of stereotype threat and tokenism. Stereotype threat is the fear that if one’s actions will confirm a negative stereotype about a group they are a part of, and tokenism is when a member of a minority group is singled out to represent or relate to that group (\“Women in Tech: The Facts\”, NCWIT 2016).",
    quote: "\"Women and girls need to see female role models in the workplace that look like them - over and over and over again. They need to receive the message that women can work in STEM careers and be successful and fulfilled in their work life, and they need to receive this message repeatedly.\" -Donna Milgram, International Technology Education Association"

    affectsWomen: "According to Catalyst’s current report on Women CEOs of the S&P 500, women make up only 4.6% of CEO’s in these companies. Of these 23 women, only 2 are in tech-related industries (Oracle and IBM). Another study shows that in Silicon Valley, the odds of being in a leadership position was 2.7 times greater for men than for women (Simard et al., 2008). Even further, studies show that the most significant factor that leads to women leaving the tech industry is lack of pay and promotion opportunities. Women need to be shown that there are opportunities for growth.",

    quote: "\“Though tech often prides itself on being a meritocracy, research shows that this is not the case.

    affectsWomen: "The recruitment process can communicate unintended, subtle bias without even knowing it. In the Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, it is shown that recruiters/interviewers can easily trigger stereotype threat—or the fear that one’s actions will confirm a negative stereotype—for women through showing an all-male work environment. Additionally, women may not feel like they are a good culture fit for the company if they are shown all males, which can lead them to go elsewhere (Walton et al., 2015).",

    affectsWomen: "Beer pong and other stereotypically \“fratty\” references incorporated into office culture can contribute to alienating women (any many men, for that matter). Workplace norms that embody the “brogrammer” culture described in articles by Wired and the NYT has been shown to contribute to women’s perception of the tech industry as \“bro-ey\” and \“testosterone-fueled\” (Sandgren, Kennedy School Review).",
    quote: "\"The environment changed, [Ellen Pao] said, after the early venture-capital firms started investing in tech. ‘They happened to all be white guys who had graduated from the same handful of élite colleges,’ she said. ‘And they tended to make investments in new firms started by people they knew, or by people who were like them.’ This created a model of hiring and investing that some refer to as the ‘Gates, Bezos, Andreessen, or Google model,’ which Melinda Gates recently characterized as, ‘white male nerds who’ve dropped out of Harvard or Stanford.’\” -Sheelah Kolhatkar, New Yorker"

    affectsWomen: "The actual, physical office space provides subtle hints about who \“belongs there.\” A workspace communicates culture and community norms, so it is best to avoid depicting an environment that might make women feel excluded or unwelcome (Hattenhauer, 1984). Data suggest that tech offices often convey a stereotypically masculine culture and related expectations. For example, in an experiment done with college students, sci-fi posters, stacked soda cans, video games, etc. made young men and women feel alienated from a company if they didn’t resonate with these \“geeky\” characteristics (Cheryan et al., 2011; Cheryan et al., 2009).",
    quote: "\"When high school girls see Star Trek posters and video games in a computer science classroom, they are less interested than boys in taking the course. When the classroom is devoid of décor, girls still opt out. It is only when an alternate image of computer science is presented by replacing geeky objects with art and nature posters that girls become as interested as boys.\” -Cheryan, Ziegler, Quartz"

    affectsWomen: "Technical complexity may be part of the job as a software engineer, but it can be seen as a method of vetting or intimidating the audience. While extreme technicality can turn both men and women away, the effects in recruitment are pronounced with female applicants due to confidence in their technical skill due to stereotypes (Correll, 2001, 2004; Margolis and Fisher, 2002).",

These words can deter people who have been raised or socialized to downplay their expertise; this is the case for many women, even if they are highly qualified.",
    quote: "\"A quick search on the jobs site Indeed.com on Tuesday found more than 800 jobs listings that included the word ‘ninja.’ The word is meant to signal that a company is looking for an aggressive candidate who’s an expert in his or her field. But to most of us, a ‘ninja’ is a dude, or, more notoriously, a ‘bro.’ Indeed, going back to its origins, the traditional Japanese ninja was a man.\” Emily Peck, HuffPost"
